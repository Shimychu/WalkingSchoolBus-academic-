REWARDS:
The Rewards are obtained after certain milestone. You do not need to spend points for rewards, instead you unlock
them after a certain threshold. There are 3 main rewards:
App theme color
App profile picture
Group Icons. (As a leader of a group, instead of a normal placemarker, my group icon will be of my reward).
    That way people are more willing to join a group that shows that the user has been leading/walking with groups for a while.


POINTS:
Points are only redeemed if your last location is not the same as your previous location. In other words you must be
walking in order to redeem points. 1 Point is earned every 30 seconds of "walking".
